I would like to record my thanks to all those who have helped me in the
course of this work. In particular, the following:

Prof. R.J. Nelmes for his guidance, assistance and encouragement, and for
introducing me to the field of high-pressure diffraction.

Dr. P.D. Hatton for his encouragement when the going got tough, and for his
unflagging interest.

Dr. J.S. Loveday with whom the x-ray diffraction experiments were done, and
Dr. R.O.Piltz for his help and companionship in the wee small hours during
experiments conducted at the Institut Laue Langevin.

Dr. H. Ahsbahs for providing access to his sapphire-anvil cell, to
Dr.~W.F~Kuhs for his expertise and patient tuition in the art of accurate
neutron-diffraction studies, and to R.~Dorwarth for developing the
variable-temperature apparatus for the Ahsbahs cell.

To Dr. G.J. McIntyre for his crystallographic expertise, sense of humour, and
considerable help in making the neutron-diffraction studies.

To the technical staff at the University of Edinburgh, the Institut
Laue Langevin, and at the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory,

To the S.E.R.C. for financial support.

To E.J.P. Fraser for many things

and to my parents, for their unfailing encouragement and support throughout, and
to whom this thesis is dedicated.
