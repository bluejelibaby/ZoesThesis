The Standard Model (SM) of Particle Physics is one of the greatest 


This thesis details the search for signs of new physics motivated by supersymmetry, requiring events with jets and missing energy. The Standard Model theory is presented in Chapter~\ref{ch:theory} along with motivations for physics beyond, and a description of Supersymmetry. The data used is taken using the Compact Muon Solenoid Detector at the Large Hadron Collider, experimental descriptions of which are found in Chapter~\ref{ch:detector}. Chapter~\ref{ch:objects} 


The work presented in Chapter~\ref{ch:ra1} is documented in a public CMS Physics Analysis Summary~\cite{} and published in ~\cite{1}. The work was undertaken by a small analysis group of which the author was a key active member singularly responsible for the $\mu$ control sample used for background prediction and in addition providing plots and yields for the signal selection. The work in Chapter~\ref{ch:ra4} represents an extension to the published analysis that is the sole work of the author, using also a leptonic definition of the \alt variable proposed and verified in work by the author, described in Section~\ref{sec:lalt}.
