My last six months have been made bearable thanks to easyjet for helping me reach CERN so often. Thanks also to Yorkshire Tea for providing me with the ``proper brew" it took to write this thesis

To all the wonderful UK LTA crew who are too numerous to name individually. Collectively you made my time at CERN the best time of my life and I one I will never forget. xs

Special thanks to the LTA ladies for girly nights! 

To my parents Jan and Adrian, who have supported me my whole life and taught me that anything is within my grasp. Thanks for always believing in me and being there when the times were toughest. 

To Chris, for loving me at my worst and being there during the hardest task of my life.
