I would like to extend my thanks to everyone who worked with me and helped me in the course of this Ph.D. I am sincerely and heartily grateful to my advisor, Jordan Nash, for the support and guidance he showed me throughout my time at Imperial College.

It has been a pleasure to be a member of the Imperial RA1 team alongside Rob Bainbridge, Burt Betchart, Oliver Buchm\"uller, Darren Burton, Edward Laird, Bryn Mathias, Henning Fl\"acher, Tanja Rommerskirchen, Paris Sphicas, Markus Stoye, and Tom Whyntie. It would also not have been possible without Georgia Karapostoli, for teaching me so much in the beginning. 

I am grateful to everyone who contributed to the design, construction and running of both the LHC and CMS, without who I would not have had data to analyse. It has been an honour to work at CERN and be part of such an incredible feat of science and engineering.

My heart goes out to everyone I met at CERN, and who made my time there so special. To all the wonderful UK LTA crew who are too numerous to name individually. Collectively you made my time at CERN the best time of my life and I one I will never forget. Special thanks to the LTA ladies for girly nights! 

Many thanks to  my parents Jan and Adrian, who have supported me through everything I have been through for my whole life and taught me that anything is within my grasp. Thanks for always believing in me and being there when the times were toughest. Finally a special thanks to Chris, for all the love and support without which I would not have made it though these months of writing.
