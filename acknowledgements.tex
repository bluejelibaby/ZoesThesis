I would like to extend my thanks to everyone who worked with me and helped me in the course of this Ph.D. I am sincerely and heartily grateful to my advisor, Jordan Nash, for the support and guidance he showed me throughout my time at Imperial College.

It has been a pleasure to be a member of the Imperial RA1 team alongside Rob Bainbridge, Burt Betchart, Oliver Buchm\"uller, Darren Burton, Edward Laird, Bryn Mathias, Henning Fl\"acher,Tanja Rommerskirchen, Paris Sphicas, Markus Stoye, and Tom Whyntie. It would also not have been possible without Georgia Karapostoli, for teaching me so much in the beginning. 



To all the wonderful UK LTA crew who are too numerous to name individually. Collectively you made my time at CERN the best time of my life and I one I will never forget. Special thanks to the LTA ladies for girly nights! 

To my parents Jan and Adrian, who have supported me through everything I have been through for my whole life and taught me that anything is within my grasp. Thanks for always believing in me and being there when the times were toughest. 

To Chris, for loving me. You
