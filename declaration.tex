The research undertaken in this thesis was the unaided work of the author, except where the work was done in collaboration
with others as indicated in the text. In this case a significant contribution was made by the author. All other work is referenced properly throughout the text. 

The analysis detailed in Chapter~\ref{ch:ra1} was performed by a small collaboration of which the author was a key member and made a significant contribution, including full responsibility for the muon control sample. The author's own personally conducted extension to the analysis is documented in Chapter~\ref{ch:ra4}.
