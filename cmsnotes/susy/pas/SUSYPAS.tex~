Following the success of the $\alpha_{T}$ jet-balancing method previously described for the all-hadronic SUSY searches, it is a natural progression to look for extensions of this approach to the single-electron search, as this too has significant presence of large backgrounds from QCD multi-jet.

The variable is now redefined as an N-object system where the set of objects is 1 electron and N-1 jets. The new definition reproduces the kinematics of a di-jet system by contruction two pseudo-jets, which balance one another in $H_{T}$. Pseudo-jets are formed from the combination of the objects by minimising the variable $\Delta H_{T} = |H_{T,1} - H_{T,2}|$, where the definition of the $\alpha_{T}$ variable is now written as:

\begin{equation}
\alpha_{T} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{H_{T} - \Delta H_{T}}{M_{T}} =  \frac{1}{2} \frac{H_{T} - \Delta H_{T}}{\sqrt{H_{T}^{2}-MH_{T}^{2}}}
\end{equation}
The basic selection for single electron events in the leptonic $\alpha_{T}$ approach has the follwoing requirements:
\begin{itemize}


\item Exactly one electron passing requirements as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $p_{T} >$ 20 GeV
\item $|\eta| <2.4$
\item Passes Cut Based ID in simple robust variables $($H/E,$\Delta \phi$,$\Delta \eta$, $\sigma_{i\eta i\eta}$, Tracker Isolation, ECAL Isolation and HCAL Isolation$)$ corresponding to an 80\% efficiency for W. 
\end{itemize}
\item The event is vetoed if there are any muons passing the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item $p_{T} >$ 15 GeV
\item $|\eta| <2.1$
\item Passes ID requirement: 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The analysis uses data samples for the QCD multi-jet background processes produced with the full simulation production for Physics at 7TeV with CMS. The Monte Carlo datasets used are detailed in Table \ref{tab:datasets}. The available luminosity is shown, although the plots are normallised to 1pb$^{-1}$. We use the EMenriched and BCtoE samples which are designed to be enriched in electrons, in order to enhance statistics. In addition, as these samples only cover the region 20$<\hat{p_{T}}<$170 GeV/c, we include the QCD Jets sample for the region $\hat{p_{T}}>$170 GeV/c.

In order to accurately predict the shape of AlphaT in this selection, it is desirable to find a suitable control sample. One way to define such a sample is using the principle of Delta ID Cut Inversion. The anti-selected events in this method pass all selection criteria except the $\Delta \phi$ and $\Delta \eta$ cuts, which are failed. 

As mentioned previously, SUSY events are expected to have high H$_{T}$. Therefore it is critical in any prediction method to understand the behaviour in leptonic AlphaT as a function of HT. The plots in \ref{fig:AlphaTbyHT} show the normalised shape of distributions, both before HT cut and the evolution with HT. The selected and anti-selected agree very well.

Shapes are normalised to unity for ease of comparison. There is good agreement between the selected and anti-selected regardless of HT requirement, and the high $\alpha_{T}$ tails reduce as expected when moving to higher HT cuts.}}
\label{fig:AlphaTbyHT}
\end{figure}

In order to demonstrate the power of HT in $\alpha_{T}$ tail-reduction, we introduce the variable $R_{\alpha_T}$ which is defined as the ratio of the number of events passing the $\alpha_T$ cut over the number of events failing it:
\begin{equation}
R_{\alpha T} = \frac{N(\alpha_{T}>0.55)}{N(\alpha_{T}<0.55)}
\end{equation}
The ``default'' cut value here is the value prompted from the all-hadronic analysis, 0.55. Figure \ref{fig:AlphaT_Ratio} shows a plot of $R_{\alpha_T}$ as a function of the $H_{T}$ cut applied. As the $H_{T}$ requirement increases, $R_{\alpha_T}$ decreases in an exponential manner. The selected and anti-selected events from Delta ID Inversion are to good agreement.

\label{fig:AlphaT_Ratio}
\end{figure}

In order to verify that the tail is not reduced proportionally to the peak, an additional set of ratios may be defined. Defining a reference istribution for low $H_{T}$ region [0,100], we can investigate distributions in higher HT bins ([100,150],[150,200],[200,250]) by dividing them by the reference distribution. These plots are shown in Figure \ref{fig:HTratios}. As the region of $H_{T}$ is increased, the difference in ratio between the peak and the tail becomes more pronounced.
