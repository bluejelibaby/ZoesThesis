\section{Establishing a deviation from the Standard Model}

In this section we describe a method for establishing a deviation from the Standard Model using the variables $\alpha_{T}$, $MH_{T}$ and $MH_{T}/H_{T}$.

First, we study the centrality of the leading jet of the standard model backgrounds and SUSY signals LM0 and LM1. Next, we investigate the contribution of each individual background to the total SM background. We define the variable $R_{\alpha T}$ which is the ratio of events which pass a cut on the value of $\alpha_{T}$ cut (the ``default'' value used is prompted by the all-hadronic analysis: N($\alpha_{T}>0.55$)) divided by the number of events below this cut (N($\alpha_{T}<0.55$)). We plot this ratio, $R_{\alpha T}$, as a function of the $|\eta|$ of the leading jet for the background only and the SUSY signal (LM0 and LM1) plus background cases. The analysis is repeated for the variables $MH_{T}$ and $MH_{T}/H_{T}$: a corresponding ratio of events passing a cut on the variable in question to those failing is plotted as a function of the $|\eta|$ of the leading jet.

\subsection{Centrality of the leading jet}

We decompose the Standard Model background into its components in order to study the $|\eta|$ of the leading jet for each background.  In figure \ref{fig:jeteta} the distributions of the SUSY signals (the LM0 and LM1 ``points'' are chosen as reference) are superimposed on the full SM background. Figure \ref{fig:jeteta}(a) shows the expected number of events in $100\textrm{pb}^{-1}$ after all cuts.  The QCD background remains the largest contribution. QCD and W+jets events show, as expected, a flatish distribution in jet $\eta$, whereas the SUSY signal tends to be rather central. The Z+jets background contributes a small fraction of the total number of events and seems to be closer in shape to QCD.

A better comparison of the shapes of the different samples is provided by the corresponding, normalized to unit area, distributions plotted in figure \ref{fig:jeteta}(b). The $b\bar{b}$ and QCD backgrounds are rather flat, compared to the other contributions. The $t\bar{t}$ background has a shape which is quite similar to that of the SUSY signals, especially in the low $\eta$ region.  The Z and W + jets events have approximately the same shape which is closer to that of the QCD events than the top events.

\subsection{The eta-HT kinematic method}

Figure \ref{fig:dists2} shows that a significant fraction of the SUSY signal is present high HT values.  As shown in the previous section, the $\alpha_T$ variable is very powerful in separating the signal and background events in two regions.  The QCD (and $b\bar{b}$) backgrounds can be controlled and, in fact, can be totally rejected by requesting that events satisfy $\alpha_{T}>0.55$. The above, plus the different eta dependence between signal and SM background samples, lead to establish the following analysis strategy.

Fisrt, we introduce the variable $R_{\alpha_T}$ which is defined as the ratio of the number of events passing the $\alpha_T$ cut over the number of events failing it:
\bea
R_{\alpha T} = \frac{N(\alpha_{T}>0.55)}{N(\alpha_{T}<0.55)}
\eea

We then study the behavior of $R_{\alpha T}$ as a function of the leading jet $|\eta|$.  This is done in different regions of $H_T$: it is expected that at low values of $H_T$ the ratio will be dominated by Standard Model processes, whereas at high values the SUSY signal will be relatively more prominent.  The basic idea is, therefore, to establish a different behavior of $R_{\alpha T}$ vs $|\eta|$ as we move from the background-dominated region (low-$H_T$) to the potentially signal-rich region (high $H_T$).

\subsection{Fitting $R_{\alpha T}$ vs eta}

This section describes an attempt to quantify the procedure of establishing a New Physics deviation from the SM background. A first method is tried by fitting the distributions of RaT vs the $|\eta|$ of the leading jet with a 1st degree polynomial ($p0 + p1 \cdot |\eta|$) using the $\chi^{2}$ method. The parameters of the fit, intercept and slope, for the background-only, as well as the signal-plus-background (bkg+LM0 and bkg+LM1) hypotheses have been plotted in bins of $H_{T}$ on figure 12 (a) and (b) respectively. One can easily observe the following:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item The background-only scenario shows flat distributions for both parameters as a function of $H_{T}$, which justifies the assumption of a constant RaT vs $|\eta|$. Instead, the fitting curves for both SUSY scenarios get an increasing incline as the HT threshold rises, leading to a clear distinguish from the background-only case.

\item Two regions in HT can be defined, depending on whether the SUSY signal is either suppressed or pronounced. A very first approach is to select the region with HT threshold below 300 GeV as the ``control region'' and the region HT$>$300 GeV as the ``signal enriched'' region. By this technique and taking into account the flatness of the background distribution, we gain the advantage of estimating the background contribution directly from the data without using any MC-driven methods. We estimate the contribution from the control region and then extrapolate to higher HT regions. This leads inevitably to an over-estimation of the background, which still itself gives a ``safety factor'' which is important when dealing with early data.
\end{enumerate}

\label{fig:sum2}
\end{figure}

Moving one step forward, we try to estimate the significance of the difference between the measured parameters (p0 and p1) with the presence of signal and the expected values in the background-only case. Thus, we calculate the quantity $\Delta p_{i} / sigma$, where:
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta p_{i} = p_{i, fit}^{tot} - p_{i_fit}^{bkg},  \\
\sigma =  \sqrt{ (\delta (p_{i, fit}^{tot}))^{2} + (\delta (p_{i, fit}^{bkg}))^{2} } 
\end{eqnarray}
with the index $i$ corresponding to the two parameters of the fitting function.
In figure 13 (a) and (b), we plot this quantity for different HT bins, for the parameters p0 and p1 respectively, testing the bkg+LM0 and bkg+LM1 scenarios. When dealing with real data, the parameter values and the corresponding errors for the background-only case will be taken directly from the ``control region''. The difference in the intercept between the signal-plus-background and background-only cases, is more than 5 sigma in the low HT regions, and gets bigger, as expected, for higher HT thresholds. The difference in the slope though, becomes more important (above 5 sigma) for HT values above 350 GeV. This reinforces the assumption of selecting the region with $H_{T}<300$~GeV as a ``control region''.
