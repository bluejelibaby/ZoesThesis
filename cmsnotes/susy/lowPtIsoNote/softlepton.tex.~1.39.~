    Events with leptons in the final state will play a significant role in SUSY searches at initial
    LHC luminosities. The energy spectra of the leptons is expected to be soft, especially in models
    where the mass difference between the initial SUSY particle and the lightest SUSY particle (LSP)
    is small. Optimization of isolation cuts for electrons in the transverse momentum range
    $5 < p_T < 30~{\rm GeV}$ and for muons in the range $3 < p_T < 30~{\rm GeV}$ is discussed. The
    results are presented in terms of SUSY lepton reconstruction efficiency and rejection of fake
    leptons and leptons from heavy quark decays. Lepton selections for single- and double-lepton
    SUSY final states are proposed.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Events with leptons in the final state will play a significant role in SUSY searches already at
initial LHC luminosities. They complement the fully-hadronic searches, providing cleaner signatures
than those based just on jets and missing energy.

SUSY models predict significant lepton production from decay of sparticles. The primary sources of
leptons are expected to be

\begin{align*}
   \tilde{\chi}_2^0     \rightarrow l^{\pm} + \tilde{l}^{\mp} \\
   \tilde{\chi}_1^{\pm} \rightarrow l^{\pm} + \tilde{\nu}_l   \\
   \tilde{l}^{\pm}      \rightarrow l^{\pm} + \tilde{\chi}_1^0
\end{align*}

The $p_T$ spectrum of the resulting leptons depends strongly on the mass difference between the
initial and final SUSY particles. For the cases in which the two SUSY particles are more nearly
mass-degenerate, the lepton $p_T$ spectrum is expected to be soft, and therefore a high
lepton-reconstruction efficiency and background rejection at low transverse momentum is required.

The standard lepton-isolation recommendations at CMS proposed by the V + Jets Cross-PAG~\cite{vjets}
have been shown to work well for lepton-$p_T$ above $\sim 30$ GeV/$c$. For lower-$p_T$ leptons,
however, these cuts can have a much more pronounced impact on the efficiency. For this reason, it is
natural to look at separate optimization of the isolation requirements for soft leptons.

\section{Lepton reconstruction and isolation requirements}
\label{sec:lepRecoIsoReq}
The analysis was performed within the SUSY PAT framework~\cite{susypat}. From the PAT data format,
reduced ntuples were produced using the procedure described elsewhere~\cite{ICNT}. The data samples are
summarized in Table~\ref{tab:samples}.

\begin{table}[htbp]

\end{table}


For the purposes of the lepton isolation performace study, we have developed a lepton classification tool based on the Monte Carlo (MC) truth information. Reconstructed electrons and muons are matched to generator level leptons ($e$ or $\mu$'s), and split into the following categories, according to the MC mother of the generated particle: i) ``Prompt'' leptons, are identified as the ones originated by the decay of a SUSY particle, a $W/Z$ or a $\tau$. ii) ``Heavy-flavor'' leptons, are coming from the hadronic decays of heavy-flavor quarks ($b/c$ decays). iii) ``Fake'' leptons are typically identified as reconstructed leptons faked by a jet. In the case of muons, the latter category includes in-flight decays of $\pi/K$-mesons, as well as jet punch-through.


%At generator level, ``prompt'' leptons are defined  as those coming directly from a SUSY decay or from
%a $W$, $Z$ or $\tau$ coming from a SUSY decay, and ``Heavy Flavor (HF)'' leptons are all other leptons
%appearing during the hadronization stage. Radiative leptons from prompt leptons were not considered
%to avoid double counting.

Matching between generated and reconstructed leptons was performed using a
cone in ($\eta, \phi$) phase space. The distance between generated and reconstructed leptons,
$\Delta R = \sqrt{(\Delta \eta)^2 + (\Delta \phi)^2}$, was required to be less then 0.5, and the
closest generated lepton was associated with the corresponding reconstructed candidate. If no
generated lepton was found within the $\Delta R$ cone the reconstructed lepton was considered to be
a ``fake''.

The leptons were reconstructed at detector level and passed identification
procedure~\cite{elecid,muonid}. Electrons that satisfied RobustLoose and muons that satisfied
GlobalTight identification requirements were selected. Generated and reconstructed electrons were
required to have $p_T > 5~{\rm GeV}$ and $|\eta| < 2.5$, muons, $p_T > 3~{\rm GeV}$ and
$|\eta| < 2.1$. In order to reduce contribution form the HF and fake leptons, additional requirements on the lepton qualiity were applied:
\begin{itemize}
\item Transverse impact parametere corrected for the beam spot $<$ 2 mm
\item Normalized global $\chi^2 <$ 10 (only for muons)
\item Number of hits in the tracker track $>$ 11 (only for muons)
\end{itemize}

Lepton reconstruction efficiency, defined as a ratio of the number of reconstructed and matched
leptons to the total number of generated leptons, was estimated using prompt leptons from the SUSY
LM1 sample. The efficiency is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:genPt_recoEff_prompt} for (a) electrons and
(b) muons as a function of generated lepton $p_T$. The efficiency decreases with
decreasing lepton $p_T$, and corresponds to $\sim 60\%$ in the lowest $p_T$ bins considered in this
analysis.

\end{figure}

Isolation properties of the reconstructed leptons were studied using
%Prompt and HF reconstructed leptons can be separated by applying additional isolation
%requirements, which are based on the following isolation variables:
 following isolation variables:

\begin{align*}
   \textrm{iso}_{\textrm{abs}}^{\textrm{track}} & = \sum_{\Delta R < 0.3} p_T^{\textrm{track}} \\
   \textrm{iso}_{\textrm{abs}}^{\textrm{ECAL}}  & = \sum_{\Delta R < 0.3} E_T^{\textrm{ECAL}}  \\
   \textrm{iso}_{\textrm{abs}}^{\textrm{HCAL}}  & = \sum_{\Delta R < 0.3} E_T^{\textrm{HCAL}}  \\
   \textrm{iso}_{\textrm{abs}}^{\textrm{comb}}  & = \sum_{\Delta R < 0.3}\left(p_T^{\textrm{track}} + E_T^{\textrm{ECAL} + \textrm{HCAL}}\right) \\
%   \textrm{iso}_{\textrm{rel}}^{\textrm{track}} & = \frac{\sum_{\Delta R < 0.3} p_T^{\textrm{track}}}{p_T^l} \\
%   \textrm{iso}_{\textrm{rel}}^{\textrm{ECAL}}  & = \frac{\sum_{\Delta R < 0.3} E_T^{\textrm{ECAL}}}{p_T^l}  \\
%   \textrm{iso}_{\textrm{rel}}^{\textrm{HCAL}}  & = \frac{\sum_{\Delta R < 0.3} E_T^{\textrm{HCAL}}}{p_T^l}  \\
%   \textrm{iso}_{\textrm{rel}}^{\textrm{comb}}  & = \frac{\sum_{\Delta R < 0.3}\left(p_T^{\textrm{track}} + E_T^{\textrm{ECAL} + \textrm{HCAL}}\right)}{p_T^l}
\end{align*}

where $\sum_{\Delta R < 0.3} p_T^{\textrm{track}}$ is the sum of the transverse momenta of the
tracks in a cone ($\Delta R < 0.3$) around the lepton direction.
$\sum_{\Delta R < 0.3} E_T^{\textrm{ECAL}}$ and $\sum_{\Delta R < 0.3} E_T^{\textrm{HCAL}}$ are the
sums of the transverse energy measured in a cone ($\Delta R < 0.3$) around the lepton direction in the
electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter respectively. Relative isolation was defined as a ratio of the
absolute isolation to reconstructed transverse momentum, $p_T$, of the examined lepton.

A scatter plot of combined relative isolation as a function of reconstructed lepton $p_T$ is presented in
Fig.~\ref{fig:recoPt_combRelIso_prompt} for prompt, HF and fake leptons respectively. The V +
Jets Cross-PAG recommended cut of 0.1 is also shown. At low $p_T$ values the cut rejects a significant
fraction of signal events; therefore, additional optimization of the isolation procedure is
needed. Since the isolation depends on the lepton transverse momentum, the
optimization is done in multiple bins of lepton $p_T$.

\section{Optimization of isolation requirements for low-$p_T$ leptons}
\label{sec:softLepIsoOpt}
%As stated in Sec.~\ref{sec:intro}, the goal of this work is
The optimization of the isolation for
leptons originating from SUSY processes requires
%. For this reason,
an additional cut $HT > 300 {\rm GeV}$, where
$HT =\left(\sum_{\textrm{jets}}p_T + \sum_{\textrm{lep}}p_T \right) $ and the sums run over all the reconstructed leptons and all the reconstructed
hadronic jets with a tranverse energy greater than 50 GeV.
This cut
defines an energy scale which is expected in SUSY production.
%motivated by the requirement that we improve soft lepton isolation at the energy scale at which
%SUSY processes are expected.

The optimization procedure was based on a comparison of signal efficiency and background rejection.
Efficiency as a function of isolation cut, $\textrm{eff}(x)$, was defined as the ratio of
reconstructed leptons with isolation $< x$ to all reconstructed leptons. Rejection as a function of
isolation cut, $\textrm{rej}(x)$, was defined as the ratio of reconstructed leptons
with isolation $> x$ to all reconstructed leptons, i.e. for all cut values $x$,
$\textrm{rej}(x) = 1 - \textrm{eff}(x)$. Figure~\ref{fig:Elec_PtCut0_PtCut1}
shows prompt lepton efficiency as a function of background lepton
rejection for each isolation variable.

For both electrons and muons, tracker isolation demonstrates

%, as expected for low $p_T$ leptons.
Additionally in the LHC startup scenario,
the low $p_T$ tracks (which mainly contribute to the soft lepton isolation)
are expected to be more reliable
than the low $p_T$ energy deposits in the calorimeters, therefore
%For these reasons, we start by optimizing the tracker isolation.
only the tracker isolation is considered in the first step of the
optimization.
%Only after finding the optimal tracker
%isolation cut will we examine ECAL and HCAL isolation. Because each SUSY analysis may require a
%different prompt lepton efficiency and purity, four different isolation cuts are defined:

Since signal to background conditions differ depending on SUSY analysis four optimization
approaches were considered:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf PureHF} \\
%Cut with highest prompt efficiency for which $\textrm{rej}_{\textrm{HF}} \geq 0.9$
Highest cut on isolation at which $\textrm{rej}_{\textrm{HF}} \geq 0.9$
\item {\bf PureFake} \\
%Cut with highest prompt efficiency for which $\textrm{rej}_{\textrm{fake}} \geq 0.9$
Highest cut on isolation at which $\textrm{rej}_{\textrm{fake}} \geq 0.9$
\item {\bf Optimal}\\
Minimizes $x = \sqrt{(1 - \textrm{eff})^2 + (1 - \textrm{rej})^2}$
\item {\bf Efficient} \\
%Cut with highest background rejection for which $\textrm{eff}_{\textrm{prompt}} \geq 0.9$
Lowest cut on isolation at which $\textrm{eff}_{\textrm{prompt}} \geq 0.9$
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:optTrackIso_elec} shows the optimized cut values as a function of the electron
transverse momentum. Linear fits to the data are also shown. The lowest-$p_T$ bin for the
{\bf pureHF}  procedure is empty, since the required 0.9 rejection power can not be achieved
by using tracking information only. The {\bf pure} procedures demonstrate an increase of the
isolation cat with $p_T$ increase, the {\bf efficient} requirement allows the isolation cut
to be almost constant with $p_T$.
%Efficient and optimal procedures show a reduced dependance on the momentum and require
%a tracker isolation less than 2 and 3 GeV respectively.
%The pure$_{fake}$ cut value is linearly dependent following the expression
%$\textrm{iso}_{\textrm{abs}}^{\textrm{track}} < (0.5 GeV + 0.227 p_T)$.

\section{Optimization of ECAL isolation after applying cuts on tracker isolation}
\label{sec:caloIsoAfterTrackCut}

An additonal background rejection power of the isolation procedure can be achieved by applying the ECAL
isolation after the tracking isolation was applied. The {\bf efficient} tracking procedure
as shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:optTrackIso_elec} and~\ref{fig:optTrackIso_muon} was chosen.
For simplicity the tracking isolation was set
to 3 GeV for electrons and 5 GeV for muons.
%A comparison with the corresponding pure cuts shows that in almost all cases the efficient cut on
%tracker isolation is lower than the pure cut (with the sole exception being electrons from 5 -- 10
%GeV). This lower cut value corresponds to a tighter requirement on isolation, so in addition to
%efficiencies of $\sim$ 90\% for prompt leptons, these cut values yield rejection rates of $>$ 90\%
%for both HF and fake leptons. Therefore, we first impose the efficient cut on tracker isolation and
%then examine the effect of this cut on ECAL isolation to determine if it can be improved by the
%addition of calorimeter-based isolation cuts.

Prompt lepton efficiency with respect to the background lepton rejection is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:trackCut_bkgdRej_sigEff_ptCut0_ptCut1} for different cuts on ECAL isolation
for leptons in the lowest $p_T$ bin.
The complete set of plots for each $p_T$ bin is given in App.~\ref{sec:ecalplots}.
 It is demonstrated that by using the ECAL
isolation after tracking isolation any background rejection power
can be achieved for electrons but efficiency of the prompt electrons drop significantly
as rejection power increases.
For muons it is not the case and there is a limit on rejection power which can not
be exeeded,  dependence of the prompt muons efficiency on the isolation is much
weaker than those observed for electrons.

% for low-$p_T$ leptons passing the tracker
%isolation cut. For electrons, it is possible to combine the tracker isolation cut with an ECAL
%isolation cut yielding high rejection of both heavy-flavor and fake leptons. For muons this is not
%possible for all $p_T$ bins, as shown.

%\textit{remaining} background leptons, after the track cut. Similarly, the efficient cut retains at
%least 90\% of the prompt leptons surviving the track cut. Thus, the overall efficiency can be
%obtained by convolving this efficiency with the efficiency of the original track cuts, shown in
