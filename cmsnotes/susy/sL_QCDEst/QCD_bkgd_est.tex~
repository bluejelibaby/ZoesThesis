\subsection{Predicting the distribution of the $\alpha_{T}$ kinematic variable by inverting Electron ID Cuts}

Following the promising results of the $\alpha_{T}$ jet-balancing method previously described for the all-hadronic SUSY searches, it is a natural progression to look for extensions of this approach to the single-electron search, where a significant presence of QCD multi-jet backgrounds is expected.

The $\alpha_{T}$ variable is here defined as an N-object system where the set of objects is 1 electron and N-1 jets. This definition reproduces the kinematics of a di-jet system by contructing two pseudo-jets, which balance one another in $H_{T}$. The two pseudo-jets are formed from the combination of the N objects that minimizes the $\Delta H_{T} \equiv |H_{T,1} - H_{T,2}|$ of the pseudo-jets, and the resulting  $\alpha_{T}$ is
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{T} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{H_{T} - \Delta H_{T}}{M_{T}} =  \frac{1}{2} \frac{H_{T} - \Delta H_{T}}{\sqrt{H_{T}^{2}-MH_{T}^{2}}}.
\end{equation}

The basic selection for single electron events in the leptonic $\alpha_{T}$ approach has the follwoing requirements:
\begin{itemize}


\item Exactly one electron passing requirements as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $p_{T} >$ 20 GeV
\item $|\eta| <2.4$
\item Passes the Cut Based ID formed by simple, yet robust, variables (these are the $H/E$, the super-cluster (SC) - track matching variables $\Delta \phi$,$\Delta \eta$, and shower shape variable $\sigma_{i\eta i\eta}$, Tracker Isolation, ECAL Isolation and HCAL Isolation\footnote{The cut based ID selection cuts are chosen to correspond to an 80\% efficiency in the $W\rightarrow e\nu$ analysis.}). 
\end{itemize}
\item The event is vetoed if there are any muons passing the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item $p_{T} >$ 15 GeV
\item $|\eta| <2.1$
\item Passes ID requirement: IsGlobalMuon
\end{itemize}
\item A jet is rejected if it is found close to a tight and isolated electron within $\Delta R$=0.5.
 The jet selection is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $p_{T} >$ 20 GeV
\item $|\eta| <5$
\item EMF $<$0.9
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}




This section is dedicated to a first approach of commissioning the alphaT observable and study its behavior in pure fake electron events. It is therefore desirable to collect a suitable control sample which will be dominated by fake electrons and eliminate sources of prompt electron events (like W events).
One way to obtain such a sample is using the anti-selection method on electron ID variables which are less correlated with the missing transverse energy. In this section, we investigate the possibility of inverting the $\Delta \eta$(trk-SC) and $\Delta \phi$ (trk-SC) id cuts in the electron selection. The anti-selected events in this method are collected with electrons that pass all selection id criteria except the $\Delta \phi$ (trk-SC) and $\Delta \eta$(trk-SC) ones. 

In order to establish the anti-selection method above, we compare next the perfomance of the leptonic $\alpha_T$ as obtained from the control sample and the actual QCD events passing the electron criteria defined in the ``signal'' region. The cutflow for 1pb$^{-1}$ is shown detailing number of events at each step for QCD and W samples, for selected in Table \ref{tab:CF_S_20} and for anti selected in Table \ref{tab:CF_AS_20}.

As mentioned previously, SUSY events are expected to have high $H_{T}$. Therefore it is critical to understand the behaviour in leptonic $\alpha_T$ as a function of $H_{T}$. The plots in \ref{fig:AlphaTbyHT} show the normalised shape of distributions, both before an $H_{T}$ cut and the evolution with HT. The selected and anti-selected distributions agree very well.

These distributions are normalised to unity for shape comparison. There is good agreement between the selected and anti-selected samples regardless of HT requirement, and the high $\alpha_{T}$ tails reduce as expected when moving to higher HT cuts.}}
\label{fig:AlphaTbyHT}
\end{figure}

In order to demonstrate the power of HT in $\alpha_{T}$ tail-reduction, we introduce the variable $R_{\alpha_T}$ which is defined as the ratio of the number of events passing the $\alpha_T$ cut over the number of events failing it:
\begin{equation}
R_{\alpha T} = \frac{N(\alpha_{T}>0.55)}{N(\alpha_{T}<0.55)}
\end{equation}
The ``default'' cut value here is the value prompted from the all-hadronic analysis, 0.55. Figure \ref{fig:AlphaT_Ratio} shows a plot of $R_{\alpha_T}$ as a function of the $H_{T}$ cut applied. As the $H_{T}$ requirement increases, $R_{\alpha_T}$ decreases in an exponential manner. The selected and anti-selected events from the electron id inversion method are in good agreement.
