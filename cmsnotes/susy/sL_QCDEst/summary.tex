\section{Summary}
\label{sec:Summary}

This study proposes two methods of data-driven QCD background estimation, and presents results from Monte Carlo and the first X pb$^{-1}$ of 7TeV data taken by CMS at the LHC. 

Following the promising results of studies into using the $\alpha_{T}$  kinematic variable in the single electron mode of SUSY searches, it is proposed that a suitable control sample in the distribution of this variable for predicting the QCD background could be obtained by inverting the $\Delta \phi$ and $\Delta \eta$ cuts in the electron selection criteria. 

The analysis uses Monte Carlo samples to perform a closure test on this method, first with a pure QCD sample, and then with W + jets contamination in the anti-selected control sample. The method proved unbiased between selected and anti-selected in these tests. 

The first look at this method under 7TeV collision data and corresponding Monte Carlo is also shown, with lowered selection to maximise available statistics.
