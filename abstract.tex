A search for new physics resulting in missing energy in events with high \Pt jets is presented. The analysis is performed with 1.1fb$^{-1}$ of 7~TeV data taken using the Compact Muon Solenoid detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2011.The kinematic variable \alt is used to control the background from fake missing energy originating from mis-measurment. The remaining electroweak backgrounds are estimated using data-driven techniques through the use of control samples. The background from boosted W decays is estimated with the use of a dedicated $\mu$ + jets control sample, while the irreducible background from Z $\ra \nu \bar{\nu}$ is estimated using a $\gamma$ + jets control sample.  A shape analysis is performed across 8 bins in \HT, with the signal selection alongside the two control samples are treated simultaneously in a likelihood fit.  The data was found to agree very well with the Standard Model only hypothesis with a p-value of 0.56, indicating no evidence of new physics. The results are interpreted in the scope of a popular new physics model, the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. Exclusion limits are set at the 95\% confidence level on the parameters m$_{0}$ and m$_{1/2}$ that set the mass hierarchies of the sparticles. An extension is also presented allowing additional signal into the muon control sample. The effect on the limit is negligible, although adopting a leptonic variable of the \alt variable increases the ratio between signal and background events significantly. We recommend this approach in searches with higher statistics in 2012.
