A comprehensive search for a final state with missing energy and jets motivated by R-Parity conserving supersymmetry is presented in this analysis. The analysis considers the first 1.1fb$^{-1}$ of 7TeV data taken by the CMS detector at the LHC in 2011. A shape analysis across eight bins of \HT simultaneously in the signal region and two control regions is performed using a likelihood fit. The data agree very well with simulation and are found by the goodness-of fit test to be consistent with the hypothesis of the Standard Model only. 

Having established that there is no distinction from the Standard Model hypothesis with this luminosity, the results are interpreted in the scope of the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, in order to exclude regions of its parameter space. Using values of A$_{0}$ = 0, tan $\beta$ = 10 and $sign{\mu}$ = +, the m$_{0}$ - m${1/2}$ plane is probed using the CL$_{s}$ statistical method and an exclusion limit is set at a 95\% confidence level. 

The exclusion corresponds to a lower limit on equal gluino masses and the mean of the squark  masses at 1.1TeV for the range m$_{0}$ $<$ 500 GeV, where the exclusion power is at its greatest. For higher values of m$_{0}$, where the 

At the time of publishing of these results, the exclusion limits far exceed those set previously by collider experiments, expanding considerably the region of the CMSSM that is incompatible with experimental results.
