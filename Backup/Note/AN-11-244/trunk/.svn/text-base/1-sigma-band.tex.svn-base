\subsection{1-Sigma band for 95\% CL limit in the CMSSM}\label{sec:1-sigma} 

For a more comprehensive statistical interpretation and as a measure
of quality of the 95\% CL in CMSSM, we have added the 1-Sigma band to
the expected limit, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:1-sigma-band-old},
which shows the 95\% CL excluded region in the CMSSM for $\tan\beta =
3$. The 1-Sigma band is obtained by generating toy MC for the event
yield in the signal-like region and in each of the control regions.
These toys are generated for the background only scenario. From these
pseudo-measurements, upper limits are calculated and the 68\% central
confidence interval is taken as 1-Sigma band. The expected limit is
taken as the median of the upper limits from the pseudo-measurements.
