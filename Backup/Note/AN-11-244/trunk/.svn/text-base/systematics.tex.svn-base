\section{Systematic uncertainties on signal efficiency \label{sec:systematics}}

The systematic uncertainties on the signal event yield are estimated
following in general the recipes discussed in ~\cite{RA1Paper} and are
split into two parts: theoretical uncertainties on the predicted cross
section of the different production processes (squark-squark,
squark-gluino, gluino-gluino) and experimental uncertainties on the
integrated luminosity and on the selection efficiency.

The experimental systematic uncertainties on the estimated signal
event yield are the uncertainty on the luminosity measurement
(6\%)~\cite{ref:lumi}, the effect of rejecting events with jets
pointing to masked ECAL regions (3\%)~\cite{RA1Paper}, the modelling
of the lepton and photon vetoes in the simulation
(2.5\%)~\cite{RA1Paper}, and the effect of the uncertainty in the jet
energy scale and resolution on the selection efficiency
(2.5\%)~\cite{RA1Paper,PAS-JME-10-010}.

The systematic uncertainties on the next-to-leading order (NLO) cross
section predictions due to the choice of the renormalization and
factorization scales combined with the uncertainties on the used
parton distribution functions amount to a 10\% systematic uncertainty.

These uncertainties are all included in the limit calculation.
