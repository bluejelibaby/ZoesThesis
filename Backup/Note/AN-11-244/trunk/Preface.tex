\section{Preface of the Authors}

The following PAS represents an addition to the already approved and
published CMS paper~\cite{RA1Paper} providing additional
interpretation material based on the RA1 search result. For the
pre-approval we have chosen to make this PAS identical to the
corresponding supporting analysis note \cite{AN-11-043}.
The decision of what material to select for public and CMS-only
consumption should be taken in consultation with the SUSY community
and ARC during the pre-approval. The PAS and AN will then be modified
accordingly after the pre-approval.

Furthermore, it should be noted that all plots showing new 95\%
exclusion limits in the CMSSM are obtained using the Profile
Likelihood approach (PL)~\cite{ProfileLikelihood}. Following a
recommendation of the statistic committee after the CWR, the final
limit for the RA1 paper was derived using the Feldman-Cousins method
(FC)~\cite{refFC}. Although it was found that FC and PL give
comparable limits for the RA1 search, we are currently in the process
of calculating all presented limits in the paper also with FC. The FC
procedure is much more CPU time consuming then PL but the results
should be available in time for the pre-approval meeting.
