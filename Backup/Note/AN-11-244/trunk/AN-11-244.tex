\abstract{ An update of the search for supersymmetry in events with
jets and missing transverse energy, based on the analysis in
Ref.~\cite{RA1Paper}, is presented.  The results are based on a data
sample of 1.1 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity recorded at
$\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV. In this search, the variable $\alpha_{\rm T}$ is
used as the main discriminator between events with real and fake
missing transverse energy, and no excess of events over the Standard
Model expectation is found.  Given this agreement, exclusion limits in
the parameter space of the constrained minimal supersymmetric model
are set. In this model, squark and gluino masses of 1.1 TeV are
excluded for values of the common scalar mass at the GUT scale $m_0 <
0.5$ TeV.  }
