\section{Summary \label{sec:conclusions}}
In this note we have presented a search for supersymmetry in dijet and multijet events using the \alt variable.
The analysis presents an update of the published paper~\cite{RA1Paper} with some further refinements. 
The study is currently based on an integrated luminosity of 1.1\fbinv, corresponding to a factor 30 increase in 
analysed data compared to the 2010 analysis. The observed \HT distribution for events with $\alt > 0.55$ is in
good agreement with the SM expectation obtained from data control samples. In the absence of a signal, limits
on the allowed parameter space in the CMSSM were set which exceed those set by previous analyses.
Squark and gluino masses of 1.1 \TeV can be excluded for values of the common scalar mass at the GUT scale 
$m_0 < 0.5 \TeV$.
