% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: External TeX parsers used on the abstract don't understand them.

\abstract{
An update of the search for supersymmetry in events with
jets and missing transverse energy, based on the analysis in
Ref.~\cite{RA1Paper}, is presented. 
The results are based on a data sample of 1.1 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity 
recorded at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV. In this search, the variable $\alpha_{\rm T}$ is used as
the main discriminator between events with real and fake missing transverse energy,
and no excess of events over the Standard Model expectation is found. 
Given this agreement, exclusion limits in the parameter space of the
constrained minimal supersymmetric model are set. In this model, squark and gluino
masses of 1.1 TeV are
excluded for values of the common scalar mass at the GUT scale  
$m_0 < 0.5$ TeV.
